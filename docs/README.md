## About Yokai Engine
Yokai Engine is a 3D game development engine made as part of an university assignment. The engine allows the user to create a scene with a GameObject system and is able to execute it's code in runtime.
The engine was make to be the most easy to be user for the users, simple but with all neaded funtionalities.

## Core Sub-Systems

- 3D Rendering
Render was done using OpenGL, in order to have a better performance the engine uses instancited meshes to avoid loding the same mesh more than one time.

- Camera
Making use of Frustrum culling the camera only show the gameobject that are in camera vision, this process was done using AABB boxes and discarting the gameobject that are not in camera vision.

- GameObjects
Create new gameobject is easy and fast as well as adding components to them. The engine uses a hierarchy system to make the scene creation easy for the user.

- Enviroment Customization
The user is able to move and dock all windows and the engine store the position of them in case of close the engine.

## Scripting System
The engine uses a Blueprint system for create the code, allowing to work in the engine without knowing any coding language. The Blueprint can be exported and imported from the pc folders.
Blueprints allow to modify any game data of the attached gameobject, in order to do that they can make use of values of other gameobjects.
